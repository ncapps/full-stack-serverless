- AWS AppSync is a managed API layer that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to interact with any data source
- One good approach to working with a microservices architecture is to provide a consistent API gateway that then takes all of the requests and forwards them to the backend services
- GraphQL introduces a defined and consistent specification for interacting with APIs in the form of three operations: Queries (reads), Mutations (writes / updates), and Subscriptions (real-time data)
- These operations are defined as part of a main Schema that also provides a contract between the client and the server in the form of GraphQL Types
